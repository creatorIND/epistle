# Epistle

Epistle is a cross-platform **desktop mail client** built using Electron, Node.js, and Svelte with SASS. It aims to liberate users from the hassle of multiple web interfaces by providing an all-in-one mail hub, ensuring seamless mail management on any OS.

*Realized this project needs better technology, hence archiving this repo. Will rebuild it from scratch, most probably using Qt framework.*
